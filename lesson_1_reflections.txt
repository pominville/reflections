1)
easy comparing of extracts of the versions
no distraction through unchanged text

2)
if bad changes were introducted one could go back to fetch the original version
in the end one could learn which wrong ways one chose throughout creating a software

3)
pro: 
logical commits introduced
history easier to understand

con:
inconsistent
you could lose code
different practices in teams

4)
multiple save is good to have all files together representing a piece of software at a certain point of time

g-docs saves only a growing document, interdependencies between docs usual

5)
git log gives a good overview of all the commits
with git diff I can really compare the changes that where made between two commits

6) 
if you break something you can easily go back to your previous version and the code is still clean, i.e. without the need to change something back
