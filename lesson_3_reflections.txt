1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- to make backup
- when working in a team

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- changes made by others might interfere with my work
- it would be confusing
